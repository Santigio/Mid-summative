# Mid-summative
C programming summative


# ALGORITHM 1

Problem - Write a C program that reads the content of a file, and prints 
out all unique words from the file and their number of occurrences. 

STEP 1 - START
STEP  2 - declare integers (i, len, index, specialWrd), MAXI_WORDS, FILE *file_path;
   & char path[100];
STEP 3 - define all declarations from step 2
STEP 4 - ask user for inputs  
STEP 5 - store user's input from step 4
STEP 6 - if user enter null values, prompt user to make changes and exit
STEP 7 - else count, convert to lower case, and remove punctuation from user's input.
STEP 8 - check if user input exit in our program
STEP 9 - if unique word exit, we ignore and print out all unique word
STEP 10 - else we store user input and count the occurance of unique word
STEP 11 - print out the unique word and it occurance.
STEP 12 - STOP


# ALGORITHM 2

Problem -Write a program that mimics a simple spreadsheet. The program should allow the user to enter numeric values, text into any cell. 
As new data is entered, the spreadsheet should be updated and redisplayed. 
The program should run until the user quits. 

STEP 1 -  START
STEP  2 - declare intergers t,i1,j1,i2,j2,k,l,m,n,row,col,i,j, & double isSpreadsheet with and array of 5 x 5
STEP 3 - define all declarations from step 2
STEP 4 - ask user for inputs  
STEP 5 - store user's input from step 4
STEP 6 - if user enter out of range(cells[5x5]), prompt user to enter correct value & jump to step 4
STEP 7 - else check if user enter a letter or numbers 
STEP 8 - store user's input into a cell
STEP 9 - ask if user want to continue to add more words or number
STEP 10 - if user choose to continue, jump to step 4
STEP 11 - else print user inputs in the spreadsheet 
STEP 12 - STOP
